Instructions
============

You don't have to build the PDF version or the stuff in the spec directory
before building one of the HTML versions. Just call one of the following shell
commands from within the 'epub' directory.

Building:
* epub: make
* web HTML: make splitted

Cleaning:
* whole epub directory: make clean
* web HTML (without cleaning the images): make clean_splitted
* images: clean_generated_imgs

About the web version
=====================

This is probably just a prototype. Known bugs / problems / missing features:
* API references are only simple hyperlinks to the corresponding header files
  on GitHub.
* Various hacks are used. Unexpected input might break something.
* minor HTML bugs, e.g., broken footnotes

The following files/directories must be accessible by the browser to make the
the complete content usable:
* 'splitted_html' and all its content
* 'style.css'
* 'img' and all png files within it

The table of contents page is located in splitted_html/index.html.

All links accross the HTML documents are relative, but they assume a preserved
directory structure. So you can put all files as a whole into subdirectories as
long as you don't change the internal file structure.

For example, let's assume the table of contents page is located in
http://example.com/foo/bar/index.html

The resulting URL structure should be:
* style.css's URL must be:
	http://example.com/foo/style.css
* the URL of the chapter page 'Introduction':
  http://example.com/foo/bar/Introduction/index.html
* First section of the 'Introduction' chapter:
  http://example.com/foo/bar/Introduction/Operating-system_framework.html
* All PNG files must be within:
	http://example.com/foo/img/
